## Persistence

- LB methods define how to distribute initial packets of session, for example based on least connections.
- Persistence profile then keeps this distributed session on one pool member, for example based on destination address.
- Connection requests from the client that do not use persistence are load balanced according to the currently selected load balancing method.
- Persistent profile is attached to virtual server as a profile
- Balancing method is attached to pool
- Most methods can work on node level and member level
- Ensure that client requests are directed to the same pool member throughout the life of a session or during subsequent sessions
- When you enable persistence, returning clients can bypass load balancing and instead connect to the server to which they last connected in order to access their saved information.
- The BIG-IP system keeps session data for a period of time that you specify
- You can write an iRule, which enables a persistence type for particular requests (for example, for HTTP traffic that includes a certain cookie version only)
- Default persistence timeout is 180 or 300 s

Persistent profiles:

- Cookie persistence - from web server
- Destination address affinity persistence - based solely on the destination IP address of a packet
- Hash persistence - a hash value may be created based on Source IP, Destination IP, Destination Port
- MicrosoftÂ® Remote Desktop Protocol persistence
- SIP persistence
- Source address affinity persistence
- SSL persistence - SSL session ID
- Universal persistence - any piece of data

Show persistence data

```
show ltm persistence persist-records
```

Cookie persistence methods

- Cookie Hash
- HTTP Cookie Insert - default method - By default, the cookie is named BIGipServer<pool_name> is inserted into HTTP reply from server
- HTTP Cookie Passive - not recomended - the server provides the cookie, formatted with the correct server information and timeout
- HTTP Cookie Rewrite - recomended - cookie is intercepted and rewritten - BIG-IP system intercepts a Set-Cookie header, named BIGipCookie -  The new cookie is named BIGipServer<pool_name> and it includes the address and port of the server handling the connection

## Local policy

- Draft policy, publish the policy, and then associate the published policy with a virtual server
- Match strategy, conditions, actions
- Matching strategies: a first-match, best-match, and all-match, user-defined
- In a best-match or first-match strategy, a rule without conditions becomes the default rule, when the rule is the last entry in the Rules list
- In an all-match strategy, when multiple rules match, but specify conflicting actions, only the action of the best-match rule is implemented. A best-match rule can be the lowest ordinal, the highest priority, or the first rule that matches in the Rules list: The lower rule the better during conflict!
- When you add a new rule, it is added to the end
- Many condition types: HTTP headers, SSL headers, TCP headers, Geo IP, CPU usage, URL category
- Different selectors: host, port, full strings, value, path...
- Different conditions: is, is not, in data group, any of
- Many actions:
    - Blocking traffic
    - Rewriting a URL
    - Logging traffic
    - Adding a specific header
    - Redirecting traffic to a different pool member
    - Selecting a specific Web Application policy

### Disable Resp mode in SSLO for all traffic

- Create LTM policy Local traffic > Policies
- Create rule
- Condition: All traffic, Action: Disable response adapt at response time
- Apply policy to ICAP service in SSLO

### Disable all methods except PUT and POST

- Condition: HTTP Method is not any of PUT POST at request time
- Action: Disable request adapt at request time

### Disable Request Adapt, Response Adapt only for certain files

- Strategy: execute all rules
- 3 rules
- Rule 1: Disable request Adapt - HTTP Method exists at request time - Disable request adapt at request time
- Rule 2 - HTTP Status full string exists at response time - Disable Response Adapt at Response time
- Rule 3: HTTP Header full string named Content-Type is in datagroup "datagroup name" at response time - Enable response adapt at response time

Datagroup type string contents:

- application/octet-stream
- application/zip
- application/x-7z-compressed

## iRules

Disable ICAP Respmode for reponses smaller then 1000 bytes. iRule is attached to ssloS_Icap-t-4 in SSLO

```
when HTTP_RESPONSE {

if { ( [HTTP::header exists Content-Length] ) and ( [expr { [HTTP::header Content-Length] <= 1000}] ) } {
            ADAPT::enable response false
      }
  }
```

## SSLO integration with Sandbox via ICAP

- This integration can and work fine
- Response ICAP mode is configured to send all HTTP replies to Sandbox
- ICAP virtual server TCP profile should be configured to increase idle timeout from 300 sec to 600 for heavy files
- File size limit can be configured via iRule, which is attached to ICAP virtual server
- What we send to Sandbox is configured using Content-Type field in HTTP and MIME types and local policy attached to ICAP Service in SSLO
- Be aware of a lot of garbage generated by Chrome and Windows updates - we can filter it in SSLO Security policy based on dst IPs and URLs via custom URL category
- Files which are downloaded via Javascript - can provide issues
- How to find out which request SSLO sends to Sandbox, more specifically Host, we need to launch on SSLO
- Sandbox in reply sends either block page and ICAP block code, or ICAP allow code plus HTTP reply(file) itself
- F5 sends to Sandbox the following:
    - RESPMOD icap://10.2.55.113:1344/response ICAP/1.0\r\n
    - X-Client-IP: 192.168.1.20\r\n
    - HTTP request
    - HTTP response - file, html page, json...
    - In HTTP reply F5 looks at: http.content_type: application/octet-stream

```
tcpdump -i 0.0 -A host 10.2.55.113 | grep Host

Host: 10.2.55.113:1344
Host: data-edge.smartscreen.microsoft.com
Host: 10.2.55.113:1344
Host: dl.google.com
```
10.2.55.113 - Sandbox IP  
This way we can know which domains to block to fight updates requests
