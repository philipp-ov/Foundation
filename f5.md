## Routing

- The BIG-IP system maintains two kinds of routes:
    - Management routes: Management routes are routes that the BIG-IP system uses to forward traffic through the special management interface. The BIG-IP system stores management routes in the Linux (that is, kernel) routing table.
    - TMM routes: TMM routes are routes that the BIG-IP system uses to forward traffic through the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) interfaces instead of through the management interface. The BIG-IP system stores TMM routes in both the TMM and kernel routing tables.
- VIPs can be advertised to dynamic routing, based on the fact if they are available or not
- It is configured in Virtual address list section

## Traffic groups

- Several traffic groups may exist, Host A may be active for traffic group 1 and Host B for traffic group B
- We can control to which traffic group which floating IP or VIP is connected: Interfaces section and Virtual Addresses Section

## Monitors

- In-TMM monitoring - capability to run ICMP, TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS monitors in the TMM process, which allows monitors to consume fewer system resources and scale more efficiently. Additionally, the feature uses SSL acceleration hardware and Server SSL profiles for HTTPS monitors

## Persistence

- LB methods define how to distribute initial packets of session, for example based on least connections.
- Persistence profile then keeps this distributed session on one pool member, for example based on destination address.
- Connection requests from the client that do not use persistence are load balanced according to the currently selected load balancing method.
- Persistent profile is attached to virtual server as a profile
- Balancing method is attached to pool
- Most methods can work on node level and member level
- Ensure that client requests are directed to the same pool member throughout the life of a session or during subsequent sessions
- When you enable persistence, returning clients can bypass load balancing and instead connect to the server to which they last connected in order to access their saved information.
- The BIG-IP system keeps session data for a period of time that you specify
- You can write an iRule, which enables a persistence type for particular requests (for example, for HTTP traffic that includes a certain cookie version only)
- Default persistence timeout is 180 or 300 s

Persistent profiles:

- Cookie persistence - from web server
- Destination address affinity persistence - based solely on the destination IP address of a packet
- Hash persistence - a hash value may be created based on Source IP, Destination IP, Destination Port
- Microsoft® Remote Desktop Protocol persistence
- SIP persistence
- Source address affinity persistence
- SSL persistence - SSL session ID
- Universal persistence - any piece of data

Show persistence data

```
show ltm persistence persist-records
```

Cookie persistence methods

- Cookie Hash
- HTTP Cookie Insert - default method - By default, the cookie is named BIGipServer<pool_name> is inserted into HTTP reply from server
- HTTP Cookie Passive - not recomended - the server provides the cookie, formatted with the correct server information and timeout
- HTTP Cookie Rewrite - recomended - cookie is intercepted and rewritten - BIG-IP system intercepts a Set-Cookie header, named BIGipCookie -  The new cookie is named BIGipServer<pool_name> and it includes the address and port of the server handling the connection

Persistence mirroring

- Need to be enabled in a profile

The BIG-IP system can mirror persistence information between peers for the following persistence profiles:

- Destination address affinity
- Hash
- Host
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- SIP
- Source address affinity
- SSL
- Universal

Show mirriored persistence records

```
tmsh show /ltm persistence persist-records
```

## Bandwidth controllers

- You apply a bandwidth control policy to a virtual server, packet filter, or route domain, you can apply only one policy at a time, and that is a static policy
- Using iRules®, you can combine static and dynamic bandwidth control policies up to eight policies on a connection, but only one of the eight policies can be a dynamic policy. A packet is transmitted only when all the attached policies allow it. The system as a whole supports a maximum of 1024 policies
- Applying a bandwidth controller policy to a route domain affects all traffic transmitted by the BIG-IP system to VLANs in the route domain, including health monitors and DNS queries
- Only static bandwidth control policies support SNMP queries
- Bandwidth controller is the updated version of rate shaping on the BIG-IP® system. These features are mutually exclusive. You can configure and use either rate shaping or bandwidth controllers, but not both. Bandwidth controllers include distributed control, subscriber fairness, and support for a maximum rate of 320 Gbps. Rate shaping is hierarchical and supports minimum bandwidth (committed information rate), priority, and flow fairness
-  Acceleration > Bandwidth Controllers 
-  Configure max rate 1 Mbps to 320 Gbps
- Add controller to virtual server

## Local policy

- Draft policy, publish the policy, and then associate the published policy with a virtual server
- Match strategy, conditions, actions
- Matching strategies: a first-match, best-match, and all-match, user-defined
- In a best-match or first-match strategy, a rule without conditions becomes the default rule, when the rule is the last entry in the Rules list
- In an all-match strategy, when multiple rules match, but specify conflicting actions, only the action of the best-match rule is implemented. A best-match rule can be the lowest ordinal, the highest priority, or the first rule that matches in the Rules list: The lower rule the better during conflict!
- When you add a new rule, it is added to the end
- Many condition types: HTTP headers, SSL headers, TCP headers, Geo IP, CPU usage, URL category
- Different selectors: host, port, full strings, value, path...
- Different conditions: is, is not, in data group, any of
- Many actions:
    - Blocking traffic
    - Rewriting a URL
    - Logging traffic
    - Adding a specific header
    - Redirecting traffic to a different pool member
    - Selecting a specific Web Application policy

### Disable Resp mode in SSLO for all traffic

- Create LTM policy Local traffic > Policies
- Create rule
- Condition: All traffic, Action: Disable response adapt at response time
- Apply policy to ICAP service in SSLO

### Disable all methods except PUT and POST

- Condition: HTTP Method is not any of PUT POST at request time
- Action: Disable request adapt at request time

### Disable Request Adapt, Response Adapt only for certain files

- Strategy: execute all rules
- 3 rules
- Rule 1: Disable request Adapt - HTTP Method exists at request time - Disable request adapt at request time
- Rule 2 - HTTP Status full string exists at response time - Disable Response Adapt at Response time
- Rule 3: HTTP Header full string named Content-Type is in datagroup "datagroup name" at response time - Enable response adapt at response time

Datagroup type string contents:

- application/octet-stream
- application/zip
- application/x-7z-compressed

## SSL

- If you enable ClientSSL cert then all SSL requests from client will be terminated on F5
- If you enable ServerSSL profile - then all requests to server will be sent via SSL - ?

### Proxy SSL

- Proxy SSL feature enables the BIG-IP system to optimize SSL traffic between the client and the destination server, without terminating the SSL connection on the BIG-IP system
    - The iRules read or write application data.
    - The BIG-IP ASM security policy inspects and protects web application traffic.
    - The BIG-IP AAM system optimizes application traffic.
    - The system passes client certificates to servers that require mutual authentication
    - Importing the certificate and key pair that the destination server uses to the BIG-IP system
    - Associating the certificate and key pair with the Server SSL profile configured for the BIG-IP virtual server used in the Proxy SSL connection

SSL Proxy sequence of events

- The client establishes a full TCP connection to the BIG-IP virtual server.
- The BIG-IP virtual server establishes a full TCP connection to the destination server.
- The client and destination server exchange SSL handshake messages.
- When the destination server sends its certificate in the SSL ServerHello packet, if the certificate matches the certificate that is configured in the Server SSL profile, the BIG-IP virtual server forwards the SSL ServerHello packet
- While the SSL handshake messages are being exchanged, the BIG-IP virtual server examines the SSL messaging data.
- The destination server authenticates and verifies the client and grants access to the client.
- When the SSL handshake completes, the BIG-IP virtual server has sufficient information to generate the appropriate tokens to decrypt the traffic.
- When the client starts sending traffic through the SSL connection established with the destination server, the BIG-IP system optimizes the traffic using the same SSL credentials that the client negotiated during the SSL handshake phase

### SSL forward proxy

- You can encrypt all traffic between a client and the BIG-IP system, by using one certificate, and to encrypt all traffic between the BIG-IP system and the server, by using a different certificate
- You must create both a Client SSL and a Server SSL profile, and enable the SSL Forward Proxy feature in both profiles



## iRules

Disable ICAP Respmode for reponses smaller then 1000 bytes. iRule is attached to ssloS_Icap-t-4 in SSLO

```
when HTTP_RESPONSE {

if { ( [HTTP::header exists Content-Length] ) and ( [expr { [HTTP::header Content-Length] <= 1000}] ) } {
            ADAPT::enable response false
      }
  }
```

Log codes from DLP servers - connected to VS ssloS_dlp_req

```
when RULE_INIT {
    set static::SyslogIP "10.1.1.228"
    set static::debug 0
}
when LB_FAILED {
    if { [active_members [LB::server pool]] > 0 } {
        if {$static::debug ne 0} {
            log local0. "LB to [IP::server_addr] is failed, reselect"
        }
        LB::reselect
    }
}
when ICAP_REQUEST {
    set http_host [HTTP::host]
    set client_addr [IP::client_addr]
}
when ICAP_RESPONSE {
    log $static::SyslogIP local0. "ICAP status code from DLP is [ICAP::status]"
    if {$static::debug ne 0} {
        log local0. "ICAP status code from DLP pool member [IP::server_addr] is [ICAP::status] for $client_addr is requesting $http_host"
    }
    if { [ICAP::status] == "503" } {
        if {$static::debug ne 0} {
            log local0. "Got 503 response from [IP::server_addr] and set it down"
        }
        LB::down
    }
}
```

## SSLO integration with Sandbox via ICAP

- This integration can and work fine
- Response ICAP mode is configured to send all HTTP replies to Sandbox
- ICAP virtual server TCP profile should be configured to increase idle timeout from 300 sec to 600 for heavy files
- File size limit can be configured via iRule, which is attached to ICAP virtual server
- What we send to Sandbox is configured using Content-Type field in HTTP and MIME types and local policy attached to ICAP Service in SSLO
- Be aware of a lot of garbage generated by Chrome and Windows updates - we can filter it in SSLO Security policy based on dst IPs and URLs via custom URL category
- Files which are downloaded via Javascript - can provide issues
- How to find out which request SSLO sends to Sandbox, more specifically Host, we need to launch on SSLO
- Sandbox in reply sends either block page and ICAP block code, or ICAP allow code plus HTTP reply(file) itself
- F5 sends to Sandbox the following:
    - RESPMOD icap://10.2.55.113:1344/response ICAP/1.0\r\n
    - X-Client-IP: 192.168.1.20\r\n
    - HTTP request
    - HTTP response - file, html page, json...
    - In HTTP reply F5 looks at: http.content_type: application/octet-stream

```
tcpdump -i 0.0 -A host 10.2.55.113 | grep Host

Host: 10.2.55.113:1344
Host: data-edge.smartscreen.microsoft.com
Host: 10.2.55.113:1344
Host: dl.google.com
```
10.2.55.113 - Sandbox IP  
This way we can know which domains to block to fight updates requests

List of domains which are used for updates:

- http://\*.gvt1.com/
- http://au.download.windowsupdate.com
- http://data-edge.smartscreen.microsoft.com/
- http://dl.google.com/
- http://edgedl.me.gvt1.com/
- http://r11---sn-n8v7znlr.gvt1.com
- http://www.google.com/
- + The same for https

## SNI routing

Using SNI we can route traffic to a destination without having to terminate the SSL connection. This enables several benefits including:
- Reduced number of Public IPs
- Simplified configuration
- More intelligent routing of TLS traffic
- No SSL profile use

Using SNI Routing we can handle everything on a single virtual server / Public IP address. There are 3 methods for performing SNI Routing with BIG-IP
- iRule with binary scan 
    - a. Article by Colin Walker code attribute to Joel Moses 
    - b. Code Share by Stanislas Piron
- iRule with SSL::extensions
- Local Traffic Policy

Local policy:
- SSl extension - server name - is-  any of - app1.example.com - at ssl client hello
- Forward traffic - to - pool - pool_name - at SSL client hello time

## One connect

## Cli

Add management route

```
create /sys management-route default gateway 192.168.5.1
save sys config
```

## iRules

Log to Syslog and local ICAP status from DLP

```
when RULE_INIT {
    set static::SyslogIP "10.1.1.228"
    set static::debug 1
}
when ICAP_REQUEST {
    set http_host [HTTP::host]
    set client_addr [IP::client_addr]
}
when ICAP_RESPONSE {
    log $static::SyslogIP local0. "ICAP status code from DLP is [ICAP::status] for $client_addr is requesting $http_host"
    if {$static::debug ne 0} {
        log local0. "ICAP status code from DLP is [ICAP::status] for $client_addr is requesting $http_host"
    }
}
```

## Logging

Logging types:

- System > Logs > Configuration > Options - Log levels for different aspects of LTM, including SSL - everything goes to /var/log/ltm
- System > Logs > Configuration > Remote logging - Regular Syslog (via syslog- ng) - Everything from log files is sent - Logs to Syslog cannot be sent via Mgmt interface
- /var/log/apm - APM logs, SSLO logs - SSL Orchestrator > Logs > Settings + SSLO topology settings
- /var/log/audit - all admin actions + authentication
- Logs > Configuration > Audit logging > MCP Verbose
- System > Logs > Configuration > Log Publishers - High Speed Logging - if you enable this, add local syslog to publisher destination, or nothing will be saved locally

Show configured Syslog servers
```
tmsh list /sys syslog remote-servers
```

Modify levels
```
modify /sys syslog auth-priv-from warning
```

Show current syslog settings
```
tmsh list /sys syslog all-properties
```

Additional filtration via CLI:

```
modify /sys syslog remote-servers none
save sys config
edit /sys syslog all-properties
include "             
    filter f_remote_loghost {
        level(warning..emerg);
    };
    destination d_remote_loghost {
        udp(\"192.168.1.1\" port(514));
    };
    log {
        source(s_syslog_pipe);
        filter(f_remote_loghost);
        destination(d_remote_loghost);  
                  
    filter f_remote_loghost1 {
        match('/var/core/.*.bld');             
        level(notice..emerg);
    };
    log {
        source(s_syslog_pipe);
        filter(f_remote_loghost1);
        destination(d_remote_loghost);
    };

### High speed logging

If you enable HSL, all logs sent to it, will not be sent to local logs, you have to create a separate HSL filter and send all required events to Local-syslog destination.
Remote high speed logging sends logs directly from dataplane without using  syslog-ng. It is faster. 

1. Create a pool where we specify Syslog servers
2. Create Log destination with type Remote HSL and specify pool name
3. Create Log destination with type Remote Syslog and specify Remote HSL log destination and syslog format
4. Create Log publisher and add Remote Syslog destination there
5. Create Log filter, configure it and attach it to log publisher (Message ID is set without :)

### SSLO Per-topology log settings

- Per-Request Policy - logs events related to security policy processing. When set to Debug, this log facility produces an enormous amount of traffic, so it is recommended to only set this to Debug for troubleshooting. Otherwise the most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions.
- FTP - specifically logs error conditions for the built-in FTP listener when FTP is selected among the additional protocols in the Interception Rule configuration. The most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions.
- IMAP - specifically logs error conditions for the built-in IMAP listener when IMAP is selected among the additional protocols in the Interception Rule configuration. The most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions.
- POP3 - specifically logs error conditions for the built-in POP3 listener when POP3 is selected among the additional protocols in the Interception Rule configuration. The most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions.
- SMTP - specifically logs error conditions for the built-in SMTP listener when SMTP is selected among the additional protocols in the Interception Rule configuration. The most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions.
- SSL Orchestrator Generic - logs events related to generic SSLO processing, such as a summary of how a connection/flow was handled. If Per-Request Policy logging is set to Error, and SSL Orchestrator Generic is set to Information, only the connection/flow summary will be logged. If connection/flow summary logging is not required the most appropriate setting is Error, which will only log error conditions. The logs produced by the SSL Orchestrator Generic facility provide a summary of details during multiple stages of the client/server connection. The Information level of severity provides a single log message per-connection, summarizing connection properties, whether it was decrypted, and which Service Chain it was sent through. The Debug level of severity produces information at multiple stages while the connection is established and .
An example of the logging that is produced by the SSL Orchestrator Generic facility can be seen below. In this example the severity was set to Debug, which includes log messages of all levels of severity, including Information:  
May  5 12:11:49 sslo1 debug tmm[11503]: 01c4ffff:7: /Common/sslo_f5labs_explicit.app /sslo_f5labs_explicit_accessProfile:Common:2cd3ff97: /Common/sslo_f5labs_explicit.app /sslo_f5labs_explicit-in-t-4 CLIENT_ACCEPTED TCP from 10.1.10.50_64258 to 93.184.216.34_443 L7 guess=https
- For the vast majority of troubleshooting cases the logging data from Per-Request Policy and SSL Orchestrator Generic (set to Debug and Information, respectively) are the most relevant. For ongoing connection summary logging to a system such as a SIEM, the SSL Orchestrator Generic log (set to Information) is usually the most relevant.

### SSLO errors in logs

All SSL/TLS handshake errors are in /var/log/ltm and are Warning and does not depend on SSLO configuration  
Most of them have SSL as a source in Log filter

### Connection summary for SSLO


/var/log/apm - For policy decisions. Most useful when troubleshooting problems with chains and services.
If you want to get connection summary  for each SSLO connection you need to configure SSL Orchestrator Generic to Information. All other is error.
After this in /var/log/apm there will be logs.

They show app, IPs, ClientSSL options, ServerSSL options, URL, decryption status, service chain
```

To send it to Syslog we need to add Log destination to Log publisher sys-sslo-publisher
These logs appear in /var/log/apm because Log publisher sys-sslo-publisher is connected to access profile and local syslog is configured as destination for this log publisher!
That is why they are not sent via regular Log Publisher, it should be connected to Access profile first

### Per-Request Policy logging

Per-Request Policy logging provides an in-depth view of the rule matching logic that is applied to each flow passing through SSL Orchestrator. The logging from this facility is very verbose, as can be seen from the example below, where a single HTTP GET request is sent to https://www.example.com. Per-Request Policy log data is sent to the APM log (/var/log/apm).
As you look through the example log data, pay attention to the following:
- Each session has a unique identifier that you can filter on (ex. using grep), in this case it is: 3a9ebee8
- At the start of each session some basic client and server details are logged (ex. IPs and ports)
- Further into the session, additional flow details become available (look for Agent created variable name messages):
    - perflow.category_lookup.result.url, value: https://www.example.com/
    - perflow.ssl.client_cipher_name, value: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
    - perflow.ssl.client_cipher_version, value: TLSv1.2
    - perflow.ssl.server_cipher_name, value: ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
    - perflow.ssl.server_cipher_version, value: TLSv1.2
    - perflow.l7_protocol_lookup.result, value: https
    - perflow.service_path, value: ssloSC_All_Services
- Log messages indicate successful or unsuccessful evaluation of each rule, such as:
    - Following rule (Fail) from item (Pinners_Rule) to item (Finance_Bypass) indicates the Pinners Rule rule did not match
    - Following rule (Fail) from item (Finance_Bypass) to item (ssloSC_All_Services) indicates the Finance Bypass rule did not match
    - This flow did not match the Pinners Rule or Finance Bypass so it was caught by the default "All Traffic" rule at the bottom of the Security Policy

```

## SSLO Troubleshooting

Site does not work via SSLO

- In browser identify which domains are used, besides main: Network in Developer Tools + 3rd party requests + Column Domain Name
- Via packet capture identify which IPs are used

```
tshark -T fields -e ip.dst -f "tcp and dst port 443 and src 10.10.10.1"
```

- Enable SSL debug logging
- Check /var/log/ltm for SSL errors
- Check if server certificate CA is in F5 bundle
- Check if server certificate is expired
- Check if certificate is pinned to client
- Enable Debug logs in SSLO and see /var/log/apm

### Check validity of server cert

```
openssl s_client -connect meetup.sberbank.ru:443
```

This command will show certificates, protocol and ciphers
If F5 does not know this certificate, there will be a error:

```
verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate
verify error:num=21:unable to verify the first certificate
```
