## Zones

Firewall types
- Route based firewall - zones are simply an architectural or topological concept that helps identify which areas comprise the global network
- Zone based firewall - use zones as a means to internally classify the source and destination in its state table  
  
Concepts
- One zone per interface
- Zones are attached to a physical, virtual, or sub interface
- Intrazone traffic is allowed by default
- Interzone traffic is denied by default
- Rules can use these defined zones to allow or deny traffic, apply Quality of Service (QoS) policies, or perform network address translation (NAT)
- If the source zone has a protection profile associated with it, the packet is evaluated against the profile configuration
- Destination zone is determined by checking the Policy-Based Forwarding (PBF) rules and if no results are found, the routing table is consulted
- Lastly, the NAT policy is evaluated as the destination IP may be changed by a NAT rule action, thereby changing the destination interface and zone in the routing table. This would require a secondary forwarding lookup to determine the post-NAT egress interface and zone
- Remember that NAT policy evaluation happens after the initial zones have been determined, but before the security policy is evaluated
- Then Security Policy is checked
- It is best practice to use zones in all security rules and leveraging a clear naming convention
- Policy check relies on pre-NAT IP addresses
- Zone protection profile, flood protection: syn(random early drop - drops random syn packets, syn cookies - are always on) icmp, icmpv6, other ip, udp; reconnaissance - port scan, host sweep. All thresholds here are aggregate for all zone. + there is packet based protection. Then we apply it in zone configuration, usually for outside zone

The policy evaluation then uses the 'six tuple' (6-Tuple) to match establishing sessions to security rules:
1. Source IP
2. Source Port
3. Destination IP
4. Destination Port
5. Source Zone
6. Protocol

## Security policy

**Options**

- Source
  - Zone
  - Address
  - User
  - Device
- Destination
  - Zone
  - Address
  - Device
  - Service
  - URL Category
- App-ID
- GlobalProtect Host Information Profile (HIP)
- Security Profiles (Content-ID) - use signatures to identify known threats. Unknown threats are identified by WildFire

**Concepts**

- Top to down
- Left to right
- More specific rules first
- Step 1: check security policy
- Step 2: apply Security Profiles: only if traffic is allowed
- Intrazone allow
- Interzone deny
- Three types: universal, intrazone, interzone: selects the type of traffic to be checked
- Use App-Id, not ports
- Separate rule for loging blocks
- Pre rules and post rules from Panorama
- Default rules
- Types: universal (default), interzone, and intrazone

## Sessions

**Session types**
- FLOW

**Session states**
- INIT

**Session end reasons**
- threat
- policy-deny
- decrypt-cert-validation
- decrypt-unsupport-param
- decrypt-error
- tcp-rst-from-client
- tcp-rst-from-server
- resources-unavailable
- tcp-fin
- tcp-reuse
- decoder
- aged-out - no ARP of router, routing issues, no reply from server
- unknown
 
## App-ID

- 6-Tuple is checked against the security policy > known application signatures > check if it is SSH, TLS, or SSL > decryption policy (if exists) > checked again for a known application signature inside TLS > the application has not been identified (a maximum of 4 packets after the handshake, or 2,000 bytes) > will use the base protocol to determine which decoder to use to analyze the packets more deeply > unknown-tcp > check policy if unknown is allowed  
- SSL > Web-Browsing > flickr > flickr-uploading  
- The application decoder will continuously scan the session for expected and deviant behavior, in case the application changes to a sub-application or a malicious actor is trying to tunnel a different application or protocol over the existing session
- If the protocol is unknown, App-ID will apply heuristics
- Use App-ID instead of service and protocols and port based
- App-ID without decryption identifies application based on server certificate: CN field, if it is exact, then it will be google-base for example, if there is a wildcard, it will be SSL app

Best pratice Moving from Port-Based to App-ID Security: set of rules that aligns with business goals, thus simplifying administration and reducing the chance of error
    - Assess your business and identify what you need to protect
    - Segment your network by using interfaces and zones
    - Identify allow list applications
    - Create user groups for access to allow list applications
    - Decrypt traffic for full visibility and threat inspection
    - Create best-practice Security Profiles for the internet gateway for all allow rules
    - Define the initial internet gateway Security policy, Using the application and user group inventory

## HA

Types:
- Active/Standby
- Active/Active
- Cluster

Concepts:
- Up to 16 firewalls as peer members of an HA cluster
- Configure HA then everything else: Interfaces, policies....
- Active firewall has less priority
- Firewall-specific configuration such as management interface IP address or administrator profiles, HA specific configuration, log data, and the Application Command Center (ACC) information is not shared between peers
- Any Layer 3 interface that is already active in the network will receive a new MAC address once HA is enabled (and committed), which could cause connectivity issues while switches and clients learn the new MAC associated with the firewall IPs. Some ARP tables may need to be cleared and static entries updated
- In Active/Passive mode, on Passive node interfaces are down by default
- In Active/Passive mode IPs and MACs are identical, when failover happens, gratuitous ARPs (GARPs) are sent. On hypervisors MACs are different, because they are set by Hypervisor, it can be changed in Palo Ato Settings
- After commit changes are automatically sent to Passive
- You can make changes on Passive, press Commit and it will go to Active

Failover reasons
- Link monitoring: If an interface goes down, the member fails
- Path monitoring: If an IP becomes unavailable, the member fails
- Heartbeat monitoring: The peers periodically send heartbeat packages and hello messages to verify they are up and running
- Hardware monitoring: The member continually performs packet path health monitoring on its own hardware and fails if a malfunction is detected

### HA prerequisites

- Model
- PAN-OS version
- UP-to-date application, URL, threat databases
- HA unterfaces types
- Licenses
- Slot configuration
- For VMs: HYpervisor, number of CPU cores

### Links

7 Links in total, all are configured in HA Communications section
- HA-1 control link (Control Plane) - should be HA type
    - L3 link, requires IP, mask, gateway - can be spanned via subnets
    - Hello, heartbeats, HA state info, User-ID, config sync
    - ICMP is used to exchange heartbeats between HA peers
    - Ports used for HA1 â€” TCP port 28769 and 28260 for clear text communication; port 28 for encrypted communication (SSH over TCP)     
    - Dedicated HA port should be used on big models, if not Management port is used
    - Monitor Hold Time (ms)â€” Enter the length of time, in milliseconds, that the firewall will wait before declaring a peer failure      due to a control link failure (range is 1,000 to 60,000; default is 3,000). This option monitors the physical link status of         HA1 ports
- HA-2 data link (Data plane) - HA type
    - Layer 2 link, ether type 0x7261 by default, available: IP (protocol number 99) or UDP (port 29281), can span subnets.The benefit of using UDP mode is the presence of the UDP checksum to verify the integrity of a session sync message
    - Session info, forwarding tables, IPSec, ARP
    - Data flow on the HA2 link is always unidirectional (except for the HA2 keep-alive); it flows from the active or active-primary firewall to the passive or active-secondary firewall. 
    - HA2 Keep-alive - recomended to enable. To monitor and maintain the HA2 connection. A log will be written in the event of a failure, or in Active/Active mode the action can be set to split datapath to instruct both peers to keep processing traffic while only maintaining a local state table until HA2 returns Plus configure action: Log for Active-passive, Split Datapath for Active/Active - each peer to take ownership of their local state and session tables when it detects an HA2 interface failure
- HA-1 and HA-2 Backup Links
    - Provide redundancy for the HA1 and the HA2 links
    - In-band ports can be used for backup links for both HA1 and HA2 connections when dedicated backup links are not available. 
    - The IP addresses of the primary and backup HA links must not overlap each other
    - HA backup links must be on a different subnet from the primary HA links
    - HA1-backup and HA2-backup ports must be configured on separate physical ports, 
    - The HA1-backup link uses port 28770 and 28260, PA-3200 Series firewalls donâ€™t support an IPv6 address for the HA1-backup link; use an IPv4 address
- HA-3 - Packet forwarding link - for active/active - HA type?
    - Layer 2 link that uses MAC-in-MAC encapsulation
    - The firewalls use this link for forwarding packets to the peer during session setup and asymmetric traffic flow. 
    - It does not support Layer 3 addressing or encryption
    - You cannot configure backup links for the HA3 link, only LAG. 
    - The firewall adds a proprietary packet header to packets traversing the HA3 link, so the MTU over this link must be greater than the maximum packet length forwarded
- HA4
    - Layer 3 type no gateway, no spaning over subnets, HA type
    - Session cache synchronization among all HA cluster members having the same cluster ID + keep-alives between Cluster members
- HA4 BAckup

### Active/Passive

Supported deployments
- virtual wire
- Layer 2
- Layer 3 

**Configuration overview**
- Enable Ping on management interface
- Configure HA type interface for HA2 link
- Enable HA and general options: Group-ID, mode, config sync, peer HA1 IP and backup IP: Device > HA > General
      - This ID needs to be identical on both members. The Group ID will also have an impact on the MAC addresses associated with each interface as they switch to a virtual MAC that both firewalls will be able to claim via gratuitous ARP in case one member fails
- Configure Active/PAssive options: Passive Link State  + Monitor Fail Hold Down Time (min) - By default, the passive device will have its interfaces in a shutdown state, meaning any connected devices will also see the link as being down. Depending on your environment, this could prevent other clusters from functioning properly, in which case you will need to set these to Auto (up but not accepting packets). Monitor Fail Hold Down Time keeps the firewall in a failed statefor the specified amount of time after an error was detected before setting the member to the passive state: Device > HA > General
      - You can enable Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) in passive mode by accessing the interface's advanced tab
- Configure Election settings: 
      - Priority - the less the better
      - Preemptive - higher-priority firewall to resume active (active/passive) or active-primary (active/active) operation after recovering from a failure. You must enable the preemption option on both firewalls for the higher-priority firewall to resume active or active-primary operation upon recovery after a failure. If this setting is disabled, then the lower-priority firewall remains active or active-primary even after the higher-priority firewall recovers from a failure
      - Heartbeat backup - This will use the management interface to send a simple heartbeat to the remote peer
      - HA Timer settings - Use recomeneded - 7 timers in total:
            - Promotion Hold Time (ms) - how long passive will wait
            - Hello Interval (ms) - hello packets sent to verify that the HA program on the other firewall is operational
            - Heartbeat Interval (ms) - heartbeat messages in the form of an ICMP ping 
- Configure HA communications
      - HA1 port - management, or dedicated, on port with HA type - if not management is used, then configure IP, mask, gateway, possible encryption and Monitor Hold Time (ms)
      - HA2 port - select transport type - Ethernet - and nothing more should be configured - Interface type - HA. Also HA2 Keep alive is recomended to enable to monitor health of HA2 link and log if something happens
- Enable HA widget on a dashboard
- Sync config
- Manually suspend node: Device > High Availability > Operational Commands > Suspend local device

### Firewall states

- Initial - after boot-up and before it finds peer
- Active - normal traffic handling state
- Passive - normal traffic is discarded, except LACP and LLDP
- Active-Primary - A/A only
- Active-Secondary - A/A only
- Tentative - A/A only
- Suspended - administratively disabled
- Non Functional - error state

### Active/Active

- Advanced design concepts
- Complex troubleshooting
- Additional configuration on both firewalls
- Recommended if each firewall needs its own routing instances and you require full, real-time redundancy out of both firewalls all the time
- Active/active mode has faster failover
- Can handle peak traffic flows better than active/passive mode because both firewalls actively process traffic

Supported deployments:
- L3
- Virtual Wire

Does not support the DHCP client. Furthermore, only the active-primary firewall can function as a DHCP Relay. If the active-secondary firewall receives DHCP broadcast packets, it drops them

4 types of design:
- Floating IP Address and Virtual MAC Address
- Floating IP Address Bound to Active-Primary Firewall
- Route-Based Redundancy
- ARP Load-Sharing

### Virtual MAC address

- Manually configure different gateways on end systems or use load balancers
- Each firewall in the HA pair creates a virtual MAC address for each of its interfaces that has a floating IP address or ARP Load-Sharing IP address
- After the failed firewall recovers, by default the floating IP address and virtual MAC address move back to firewall with the Device ID [0 or 1] to which the floating IP address is bound
- When a new active firewall takes over, it sends gratuitous ARPs from each of its connected interfaces to inform the connected Layer 2 switches of the new location of the virtual MAC address. 

### Route based redundancy

- Firewalls are connected  to routers, not switches
- Each firewall has separate IP addresses, sessions are synced
- If firewall fails, then based on routing protocol traffic is not sent to it
- No need to configure virtual MAC address/floating IP address, arp load sharing, failover conditions
<img width="602" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116812447/215494580-eeaed00c-52a0-479c-b8db-909f8cce27fc.png">

### ARP load sharing

- Use only when firewall is default gateway for end hosts
- Everytime different firewall replies on ARP request with its own virtual MAC, IP is the same for both firewalls
- ARP load sharing on LAN side and floating IP on the other

### Cluster

- 2 HA4 interfaces(primary and backup) with type HA, IP address, mask
- On every device add all over devices with serial number, HA4 and HA4 backup IP addresses and sessions sync
- Enable cluster on all devices with the same cluster ID
- Zone names should be identical
- All appliances should be configured on all devices with HA4 IP addresses
- Session is logged on that device, where it ended
- On Passive devices cluster is inactive
- TCP handshake should pass one firewall, otherwise asymmetric path bypass should enabled on internal zone
- Security checks cannot be done with asymmetric
- HA peers in the cluster can be a combination of HA pairs and standalone cluster members
- Only the firewall that is the session owner creates a traffic log
- The new session owner (the firewall that receives the failed over traffic) creates the traffic log

**Use cases**
- HA peers are spread across multiple data centers
- One data center is active and the other is standby
- Horizontal scaling, in which you add HA cluster members to a single data center to scale security and ensure session survivability: Load balancer sends traffic to many NGFWs

**Session Synchronization States **
- Pending â†’ Synchronization is not triggered yet
- Unknown. â†’ Device Serial Number and Peer IP is configured but session synchronization process has not started yet
- In-Progress  â†’ Full session synchronization is running 
- Completed  â†’ Full session synchronization is completed and new sessions will be synchronized in real time 
- Disabled â†’ Session synchronization is disabled to the member or for HA peer

Show logs about HA4 sessions sync
```
show log system | match ha4
```

## User-ID

- Runs either on the firewall (agentless implementation)
- Separate process on a Microsoft Windows Server-based host
- Redirect HTTP requests to a Captive Portal login: Browser challenge: Uses Kerberos or NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or Web form, MFA, Client Cert
- Monitors Security Event logs for successful login and logout events on Microsoft domain controllers, Exchange servers, or Novell eDirectory
- Microsoft Terminal Services or Citrix environments - Agent - Source port is used
- Linux terminal servers - XML API to send user mapping information from login or logout events to User-ID
- Syslog Parse Profiles
- XFF headers: If a proxy server exists between users and a firewall
- Global Protect
- XML API
- Client probing: Windows Management Instrumentation or NetBIOS - not recomended
- 100 domain controllers or 50 syslog servers - MAX
- Firewalls share user mappings and authentication timestamps as part of the same redistribution flow
- Before a firewall or Panorama can collect user mappings, you must configure its connections to the User-ID agents or redistribution points
- Four domain controllers within an LDAP server profile for redundancy
- If you have universal groups, create an LDAP server profile to connect to the root domain of the global catalog server on port 3268 or 3269 for SSL. Then, create another LDAP server profile to connect to the root domain controllers on port 389 or 636 for SSL. This helps ensure that both user and group information is available for all the domains and subdomains
- Maximum of 512k users in a domain
- User-ID agent is launched under the same User name as it connects to AD

Use Agentless (PAN-OS)
- If you have a small-to-medium deployment with few users and 10 or fewer domain controllers or exchange servers
- If you want to share the PAN-OS-sourced mappings from Microsoft Active Directory (AD), Captive Portal, or GlobalProtect with other PA devices (maximum 255 devices)
- Saves network bandwidth

Use User-ID Agent (Windows)
- If you have a medium-to-large deployment with many users or more than 10 domain controllers
- If you have a multi-domain setup with a large number of servers to monitor
- Save processing cycles on the firewallâ€™s management plane

### Configure managed service account on Windows AD
- Active Directory Users and Computers > Managed Service Accounts > New User
- Allow the service account to read the security log events
- Active Directory Users and Computers > Builtin > Event Log Readers > Add new managed service account
- Allow WMI: Active Directory Users and Computers > Builtin > Distributed COM USers - add amanged service account
- Add user-id managed service account to Server Operators group
- 


AD has to generate logs for Audit Logon, Audit Kerberos Authentication Service, and Audit Kerberos Service Ticket Operations events. At a minimum, the source must generate logs for the following events:
- Logon Success (4624)
- Authentication Ticket Granted (4768)
- Service Ticket Granted (4769)
- Ticket Granted Renewed (4770)

### Configure agentless
- Enable User-ID in a zone options

## QOS

QoS is enforced on traffic as it egresses the firewall  

Unclassified traffic enters firewall > **QoS Policy** assignes **class** to traffic > **QoS Profile** on Egress interface prioritizes traffic accorsing to **QoS class**  

- QoS profile - matching traffic is then shaped based on the QoS profile class settings as it exits the physicalinterface. Each QoS profile rule allows you to configure individual bandwidth and priority settings for up to eight QoS classes, as well as the total bandwidth allowed for the eight classes combined. In every profile you configure priorities for every class. Then you apply a profile to an interface.
- QoS policy - define traffic you want to receive QoS treatment and assign that traffic a QoS class. QoS policy rule is applied to traffic after the firewall has enforced all other security policy rules, including Network Address Translation (NAT) rules.
- QoS egress interface - this is where you apply QoS profile. If you limit Youtube then Egress interface is Internal interface of FW. You apply it in separate section Network > QoS

Define a QoS policy rule to match to traffic based on:
- Applications and application groups
- Source zones, source addresses, and source users
- Destination zones and destination addresses
- Services and service groups limited to specific TCP and/or UDP port numbers
- URL categories, including custom URL categories
- Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and Type of Service (ToS) values, which are used to indicate  the level of service requested for traffic, such as high priority or best effort delivery

To place the local HA peer into a suspended state and temporarily disable HA functionality on it
```
request high-availability state suspend
```

To place the suspended local HA peer back into a functional state
```
request high-availability state functional
```

Sync config to remote peer
```

```

## Packet capture

- Packets are captured on the dataplane vs on the interface

**Filters**
- Filters are not mandatory

**Stages**
- drop stage is where packets get discarded. The reasons may vary and, for this part, the global counters may help identify if the drop was due to a policy deny, a detected threat, or something else
- receive stage captures the packets as they ingress the firewall before they go into the firewall engine. When NAT is configured, these packets will be pre-NAT
- transmit stage captures packets how they egress out of the firewall engine. If NAT is configured, these will be post-NAT
- firewall stage captures packets in the firewall stage

## Log filtering

Show only ICMP protocol
```
(proto eq icmp) 
```

## Troubleshooting

Show system logs
```
show log system
```
