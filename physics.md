Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable.

- Acoustic
- Mechanical

Analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent of the telephone  

First digital transmissions:

- Telegraphy (1809)
- Teletypewriters (1906)

The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal:

- Electrical voltage
- Radiowave
- Microwave
