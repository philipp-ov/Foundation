History

- Telegraphy - 1809
- James Clerk Maxwell - theory of electromagnetism -  Maxwell's equations - coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an "electromagnetic wave"
- Radio waves in Herz lab - 1887
- Guglielmo Marconi radio - 1894 
- Teletypewriters - 1906

The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal:

- Electrical voltage
- Radiowave
- Microwave
- Infrared signal

## Analog signal

Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. Analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent of the telephone.
  
## Radio waves

- Radiated by charged particles when they are accelerated
- Produced artificially by time-varying electric currents
