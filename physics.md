## Electricity

- Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus - rubbing amber with animal fur would attract objects like feathers
- 1600 - William Gilbert - Neo-Latin electricus, meaning "like amber" - De Magnete
- 1745 - Leyden jar - early capacitor, or a device for storing an electric charge
- 1752 - kite, lightning, Franklin - Positive and negative on batteries - from Franklin times - He robbed glass with cloth and then if someone touches glass - he gets a shock  - Fraklin described it as flow of fluid from positive to negative. - This is conventional current.
- Joseph Thompson - called this fluid an electron - so flow is from negative to positive. When you robb a glass with the cloth - you revove electrons from the glass - and then electrons go from human to glass. It was called electron flow. So electrons go fron negative to positive.
- AC - electrons change direction every second - is used for transforming electricity
- DC - used in electrin circuts - DC is easier to control and allows circuits to be smaller and more compact
- 1800 - Alessandro Volta - first electric battery, known as the 'voltaic pile'

### Voltage

- It is a pressure which pushes electrons
- Two cells consequently - it will double the voltage - 1.5 * 2 = 3V
- Two cells in paralell  - voltage is the same - but the lamp will work longer
- We can measure voltage even witgour circut and electron flow
- The more voltage the more current

### Current

- Flow of electrons
- Via copper - very good conductor
- Rubber - insulator
- Flows from + to -
- To make electrons moving we need to apply a voltage
- We cannot measure current without circut and electron flow
- If too many electrons are sent via wire - it will burn
- Ampers
- The more electrons - the more current is
- One Amp is equal to One Coulomb per second
- Current measurment is done in-line
- One Coulomb = Six quintillion, two hundred and forty two quadrilion electrons per second 6,424,000,000,000,000,000 6.24×10^18
- The current is absolutely the same in any part of the socket
- Resistor reduce the current - resistor always heat

## Electronics

- Electronics is a subfield of electrical engineering

## Electronic components

- Fuse - breaks because of heat and prevents damage of expensive components
- Circut breaker - overload protection + short circut protection

## Electromagnetic radiation

Electromagnetic radiation - waves of electromagnetic field  
Electromagnetic field -  field produced by moving electric charges
  
Electromagnetic radiation types:

- Radio waves
- Microwaves
- Infrared
- Visible light
- Ultraviolet
- X-rays
- Gamma rays

The terms light, electromagnetic waves, and radiation all refer to the same physical phenomenon: electromagnetic energy.  
This energy can be described by frequency, wavelength, or energy. All three are related mathematically such that if you know one, you can calculate the other two. Radio and microwaves are usually described in terms of frequency (Hertz), infrared and visible light in terms of wavelength (meters), and x-rays and gamma rays in terms of energy (electron volts). This is a scientific convention that allows the convenient use of units that have numbers that are neither too large nor too small.

Electricity can be static, like the energy that can make your hair stand on end. Magnetism can also be static, as it is in a refrigerator magnet. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice-versa—the two are linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.  
  
In the 1860's and 1870's, a Scottish scientist named James Clerk Maxwell developed a scientific theory to explain electromagnetic waves. He noticed that electrical fields and magnetic fields can couple together to form electromagnetic waves. He summarized this relationship between electricity and magnetism into what are now referred to as "Maxwell's Equations."

In 1888 Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, applied Maxwell's theories to the production and reception of radio waves. The unit of frequency of a radio wave -- one cycle per second -- is named the hertz, in honor of Heinrich Hertz.

His experiment with radio waves solved two problems. First, he had demonstrated in the concrete, what Maxwell had only theorized — that the velocity of radio waves was equal to the velocity of light! This proved that radio waves were a form of light! Second, Hertz found out how to make the electric and magnetic fields detach themselves from wires and go free as Maxwell's waves — electromagnetic waves.

The number of crests that pass a given point within one second is described as the frequency of the wave.  

One wave—or cycle—per second is called a Hertz (Hz)  

The distance between crests is the wavelength

The shortest wavelengths are just fractions of the size of an atom, while the longest wavelengths scientists currently study can be larger than the diameter of our planet!

## Communications

- Digital communications  
- Data communications  
- Telecommunications

Data communication before electronic era:

- Optical
- Acoustic
- Mechanical

History

- Telegraphy - 1809
- James Clerk Maxwell - theory of electromagnetism -  Maxwell's equations - coupled electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an "electromagnetic wave"
- Radio waves in Herz lab - 1887
- Guglielmo Marconi radio - 1894 
- Teletypewriters - 1906

The data are represented as an electromagnetic signal:

- Electrical voltage
- Radiowave
- Microwave
- Infrared signal

## Signal

- Function that conveys information about a phenomenon
- A signal is any variation of a medium that conveys information
- Any observable change in a quantity over space or time (a time series), even if it does not carry information: in time can change speed of the bike, voltage, current - then we draw a graph of these changes in time
- In electronics and telecommunications, signal refers to any time-varying voltage, current, or electromagnetic wave that carries information

## Analog signal

Analog transmission is a method of conveying voice, data, image, signal or video information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude, phase, or some other property in proportion to that of a variable. Analog signal data has been sent electronically since the advent of the telephone.
  
## Radio waves

- Radiated by charged particles when they are accelerated
- Produced artificially by time-varying electric currents
